# BrainFx-AngularJS

## This is what i have made with the little time that i've had. i spent the first 2-3 days re-learning agnualrjs version 1
## because i hadn't used it in a long time but it wasn't that hard since the syntax was alot similar like the newer versions.

## although it's simple but it's just to show you that im capabale of working with angularjs version 1 if you want something 
## more complicated i have no issue doing so as long as it is not that long. i leave the decision to you to see if im a good 
## fit to join your team or not.

## hope to hear from you soon.

side not:

i only included the src files because the node modules were giving me a hard time for some reason.
